# Zentasks Application

Zentasks is a task management application designed to streamline task organization and improve productivity. It combines modern technologies to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience.

## Key Features

### Built with a Context and Reducer Pattern
- Utilizes two contexts: one for managing state and another for handling dispatch actions. This architecture promotes a clean and maintainable codebase.

### View Transitions API
- Implements the View Transitions API to create smooth animations when tasks are added or removed, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Zod for Input Validation
- Employs Zod to validate user inputs, ensuring reliable data entry and maintaining application integrity.

### flushSync for DOM Painting
- Leverages flushSync to optimize DOM updates, enabling immediate and responsive rendering for a seamless interface.

## About the Application

I developed the Zentasks application to empower individuals seeking better control over their daily tasks and to support them in achieving their productivity goals. The application simplifies task management by providing a clear and intuitive interface for organizing, adding, and removing tasks efficiently.

For the tech stack, I chose Vite for its fast build times, NextAuth for seamless authentication, Firebase for reliable data persistence, and Zod for robust validation.

## Technologies

This app uses the following technologies:

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** Type-safe JavaScript for scalability and better development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Vite:** Next-generation build tool that is fast and modern.
- **React with Context and Reducer:** This design pattern allows controlled over how state is consumed and re-renders happen in the application.
- **View Transitions API:** An API that allows UI animation between two contexts (supported on some browsers).
- **LocalStorage API:** To store theme tasks for data persitence.
- **flushSync:** For handling in-app navigation.
